# [The Cable Bible](https://amiaopensource.github.io/cable-bible)
A comprehensive guide to cables and connectors potentially used for audiovisual/media preservation. Now hosted on GitHub Pages, at https://amiaopensource.github.io/cable-bible

You can also install the latest [release](https://github.com/amiaopensource/cable-bible/releases) on your computer with the command:
